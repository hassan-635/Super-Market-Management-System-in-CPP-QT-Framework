# Super-Market-Management-System-in-CPP-QT-Framework

This is the second semester project made by us in GUI in the QT framework of C++.
We firstly use MYSQL in this project (Linux) but when it comes to Windows operating System we changed database from MYSQL to SQLITE due to some configuration errors and this remains in SQLITE database.

In this project we also learned embedding databases in C++ applications and developing GUI applications and softwares.

## Tools used in project :
#### 1.QT Creator
#### 2.CPP
#### 3.HTML (for designing UI)
#### 4.XML (for UI)
#### 5.SQLITE/MYSQL (for database)

## Features :
#### Wide Database :
1. You can add many admins as much as you can
2. Each admin has its own many shops
3. Each shop has a unique shopkeeper
4. Each shop has many items

#### Security :
1. Each admin has own unique username generated by the software
2. Each admin can create his own password at the time of login which can be modified when required
3. Each admin can add many shopkeepers whose username are generated by the software
4. Each shopkeeper has own password that can be modified only by his own respected admin
5. Each Shop has many items and each item can be added, modified and deleted by its own shopkeeper after entering password and username of that respected shopkeeper

This software can only work when you have QT library installed. Also make sure installation of database
